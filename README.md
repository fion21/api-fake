# api-fake

Trial api mock with landing page, and db search from address bar.

Using a mock api called Json-server.

The purpose of this project is to simulate fake/mock data in a situation where we do not wish to rely on an external dependency. It helps with the front-end workflow, to demonstrate an as if scenario, so that a few model/dummy data can envisage the flow of how the project would run when a real dataset is authorized.
